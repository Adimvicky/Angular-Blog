This is a blog app created using [Angular's quickstart files](https://github.com/angular/quickstart). It consumes a blog posts API on [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and also makes post requests to the same API when a user submits a new post.

To get this app running on your local machine, you'd need to clone this repo right on github using the *clone* button, 
you could also do this on your terminal by running..

> git clone https://github.com/adimvicky/Angular-Blog.git *project name*

Change directory into the project folder using..

> cd *project name*

then run 

> npm install

this would install all the required dependencies for the project. Next up, run..

> npm start

to get the app running on your localhost!
